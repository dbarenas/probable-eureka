# PostgreSQL Connection Details
# These are used by docker-compose to initialize the 'db' service
# and by the 'app' service to connect to the 'db' service.
POSTGRES_USER=user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_DB=ragdb

# OpenAI API Key
# Required by the FastAPI application ('app' service) for embeddings and LLM.
# Replace with your actual OpenAI API key.
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your_openai_api_key_here"

# Optional: Override default host/port for services if needed,
# though defaults in docker-compose.yml and main.py are generally fine.
# These variables are primarily for documentation or if you run services
# outside of the default docker-compose setup.

# For the 'app' service to connect to the PostgreSQL 'db' service:
# DB_HOST=db
# DB_PORT=5432

# For the 'app' service to connect to the 'chroma' service:
# CHROMA_HOST=chroma
# CHROMA_PORT=8000 # This is the internal port Chroma listens on within the Docker network.
                  # docker-compose.yml maps this to 8001 on the host.

# For local development outside Docker (e.g., running main.py directly),
# you might use these overrides in your actual .env file:
# DB_HOST_LOCAL=localhost
# CHROMA_HOST_LOCAL=localhost
# POSTGRES_PORT_LOCAL=5432 # If your local PG is on 5432
# CHROMA_PORT_ON_HOST=8001 # If Chroma is mapped to 8001 on host
